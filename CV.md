**Jun-Dong Zhang** is an undergraduate student in [Tanwei College](https://www.twc.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University, Beijing](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). He is currently a junior student participating in a double bachelor's degree project, chasing for a BS degree in *Chemistry and Biology* and meanwhile a BE degree in *Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering*. He is a member of the *Spark Project* for future innovators in science and technology.

Jun-Dong Zhang's **current research interests** focus on advanced materials, frontier chemistry theories, and energy storage systems, especially high-energy-density lithium batteries. His **recent works** afford insights into the phase field model (PFM) of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the surface of lithium metal anodes, which is expected to effectively guide the rational design of safe and efficient lithium metal batteries (LMB).

Jun-Dong Zhang holds optimistic attitudes toward the development of science and technology in the 21st century. He is willing to carry out interdisciplinary researches as well as to integrate the advantages of theoretical computations, experiments, big-data analyses and artificial intelligence (AI) advances. He is open to and keen on new things.

Apart from his research efforts, Jun-Dong Zhang also sits as the President of the Students' Association of Science and Technology of Tanwei College. In the meantime, he serves as the leader of the Competition team in the Student Scientific Innovation Center, Tsinghua University.
