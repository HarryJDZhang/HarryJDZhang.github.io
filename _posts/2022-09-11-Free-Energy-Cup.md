Come and join us to build your own chemical-reaction-driven car! 

But wait ... Building a whole small-sized automobile within 3 months, using merely chemical or electrochemical reactions as power supply and brake control? Is that possible? Our answer is yes.

## Here comes the 2022 Tsinghua *Free Energy* Cup!

<font size=2 color=grey>This video was made several years ago when our senior schoolmates participated in the global AIChE Chem-E-Car Competition. Sincere respect and gratitude to them and their outstanding work. We also acknowledge the efforts of Mr. Huanyu LIU, who translated the captions in the video from English to Chinese.</font>

### What is the Tsinghua *Free Energy* Cup?
The Tsinghua *Free Energy* Cup is a competition in which participants are required to construct their own car that is **driven and controlled _solely_ by chemical or electrochemical reactions**. The car will be asked to carry a *given* amount of inert weight and travel a *given* distance within 2 minutes. The car that travels most accurately wins the *Free Energy* Cup.

### What are the primary rules of the *Free Energy* Cup?
The competition is composed of 2 stages: 
- In **stage I**, participants are required to submit their engineering document package (EDP) with safety analysis reports; meanwhile, they are supposed to produce a delicate poster for presentation.
- Teams that meet all the safety standards will enter **stage II**, where the performance of the car will be fairly tested. Each car will be given **2 chances**.
  - In Round 1, the departure order of the cars will be determined by drawing lots. 
  - In Round 2, the car that performed best during the previous round will be the last to set off. The rest of the cars will set off ahead of it according to their performances in Round 1.

The amount of inert weight that the car is to carry and the distance that the car is supposed to travel will be announced by referees **1 hour before the first car of Round 1 sets off**. The weight and the distance will not be altered between the two rounds.

Participants shall make teams with **no more than 5 members** to register successfully. Only undergraduate students in Tsinghua University are qualified to participate as competitors, but there are **no restrictions in majors or grades of the participants**.

To read more about the competition rules, please [CLICK HERE](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fNlu0OaLqI6QLAr306_kSA). If certain concerning questions still bother you, please feel free to contact us via e-mail (thufreeenergy@163.com) or the WeChat Group (please scan the QR code at the bottom).

### What kind of support will the participants get?
Participants will be offered various and sufficient supports from every aspect: 
- **Reagents and chemistry labs** will be provided and supervised reasonably without cost by the Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Tsinghua University.
- **Instruments (such as 3-D printers) and necessary mechanical materials** will be provided by iCenter of Tsinghua University. Each team will be granted a sum of money to purchase other parts required by the car.
- **Inspiring and fruitful lectures** about race strategies, processing techniques, safety concerns, etc. will be organized by respectable professors and outstanding alumni in the field of related industry.

### What are the rewards for participants?
Teams that perform excellently in varied dimensions will **be awarded with up to 10,000 RMB _yuan_.** Moreover, participants will surely acquire deeper insights into the combination of scientific theories and engineering techniques, which is invaluable to our future career. So please do not hesistate to join us. The *Free Energy* Cup is waiting for you!
